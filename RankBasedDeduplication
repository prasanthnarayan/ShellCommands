Rank based deduplication
=======================

ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY <<Deduplication columns>> ORDER BY <Ordering column> DESC) AS <<column alias>> FROM ${DB_NAME}.<<TABLE_NAME>> where ABC ='XYZ') <<QUERY_ALIAS>>
WHERE <<QUERY_ALIAS>>.<<column alias>> = 1

--example
select
   a.id,
   a.rank
  
from
   (select
      id
      ,ROW_NUMBER() over (partition by 
                        id 
                        
                        order by id) as Rank
   from
      DB_NMAE.TBALE_NAME
   ) as a
      
where
   a.Rank=1
order by
   a.ID;
